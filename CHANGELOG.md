# v11.3.2

## Chores
- [#113] Merged language updates from Crowdin

# v11.3.1

## Bugfix
- [#110] Migrations not running correctly

# v11.3.0

## Enhancements
- [#13] Add new Settlement Actor and corresponding sheet
- [#37] The following character sheet fields are now auto-calculated and have new variables that can be used to adjust them with Active Effects if needed:

	* **Defense** (adjusted by `system.defense.bonus`)
	* **Max Health** (adjusted by `system.health.bonus`)
	* **Initiative** (adjusted by `system.initiative.bonus`)
	* **Melee Damage** (adjusted by `system.meleeDamage.bonus`)
	* **Next Level XP** (*no adjustment available*)

- [#38] Automatically set the initiative for actors added to the combat tracker
- [#43] Add support for ammo types that have multiple charges/shots per item
- [#45] Added Junk, Common, Uncommon and Rare Material numeric fields to character sheet
- [#50] Display the system release notes the first time a world is loaded in a new version of the system
- [#55] Show the amount of remaining shots for each favourite weapon on the status page
- [#59] Added new Trait item and display them on the character sheet along with Perks
- [#61] Changes to Dialog2d20 class to help with possible module integrations (thanks to AngryBeaver of Beaver's Crafting fame)
- [#69] Add ability to consume Consumable items and adjust thirst, hunger, hp, rads, etc. accordingly.

	* This handles HP/Radiation damage healing, Chem addiction rolls, and also adjusts Hunger and Thirst levels appropriately.  Any other effects still need to be handled manually at the moment.

- [#71] Add new Intoxication condition field to help track the amount of alcoholic beverages consumed during a session
- [#75] Add Radiation Healed field to Consumable items, as they are all potentially able to heal Radiation damage
- [#77] Seperate consumable addictive field into a boolean Addictive checkbox and a numeric Addiction Number for clarity
- [#78] Add new Addiction item type, similar to Disease items, and displayed on the Status screen
- [#81] Non-Character weight calculations

	* NPCs and Creatures both now have their inventory weights calculated, and you are now able to set a carry capacity on Creatures

- [#85] Add Macro to start a new game session

	* This is called **"New Session"** and it resets the Party AP to zero, sets the GM AP to the number of players and resets the Intoxication (the number of alcoholic drinks consumed by the player during a session) and Chem Dose counters to zero ready for a new game session

- [#86] Add group field to Consumable items to allow for different items sharing the same addiction name
- [#87] Add flag to show whether food consumable items count as prepared or not
- [#88] Switch Chem consumable's Duration field to a drop-down

	* The migration script for this change will attempt to determine which Duration to use, but this will only work for non-abbreviated English language names that match (in a non-case-sensitive way) the names of these durations somewhere in the string.  Any items whose duration can't be migrated will be given the template default of "instant".

- [#91] Add Thirst Reduction value to Beverage consumables
- [#92] Create new interface for managing the amount of Chem doses a character has taken this session

	* This can be accessed by clicking the "pill" button in the Addictions table list (character sheet Status tab).  If the character already owns an "Addiction" item with the same name as the Chem (or Chem Group for Chems which share the same addiction), then rolls for addiction are no longer made

- [#94] Add new item type for settlement Objects and Structures
- [#99] Lock and add tooltips to sheet fields that are being overridden by active effects

## Bugfixes
- [#34] Weapon Qualities and Damage Effects should be displayed in (localised) alphabetical order on Weapon item sheet
- [#51] Item quantity boxes polluting actor data when altered
- [#60] Use localized skill names to sort and display alphabetically on Character sheet
- [#65] Stash button alignment issue on Character sheet Apparel tab
- [#66] Power Armor health status showing values when no power armor in use
- [#68] New Consumable item sheet defaults to Food, but Food parameters not shown until selection changed
- [#70] Consumable chat card shows irrelevant details
- [#72] Consumable `system.addictive` field should be a numeric
- [#74] Chems are able to heal HP as well, so the field should be available on the item sheet for them
- [#93] Custom skill names not displayed correctly due to i18n translation missing

## Chores
- [#33] Merged Polish language updates from Crowdin
- [#35] Remove usage of deprecated `ActiveEffect._getSourceName()`
- [#36] Remove usage of deprecated `ActiveEffect#label`
- [#46] Implement schema migration tools ready for likely schema changes
- [#64] Add ability to filter item compendiums by source ready for future work
- [#79] Merged some corrected Polish translations (thanks to Sanawabicz)
- [#89] Translate as much as possible of the config at startup
- [#97] Refactor sheet classes to more easily share code without constant type checking
