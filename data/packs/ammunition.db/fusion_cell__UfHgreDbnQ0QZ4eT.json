They use volatile hydrogen isotopes which undergo fusion when subjected to extreme heat and pressure, and they can explode if exposed to a significant external heat source. Difficult to refuel without the proper facilities, these cells are often simply disposed of when depleted.</p>\n<p>When fusion cell ammunition is found, it is in the form of a single cell containing the number of shots generated.</p>\n<p><strong>Quantity Found:</strong> [[/r 14+7 # Fusion Cell]]</p>",
