The rarity of its manufacture means that it&rsquo;s hard to acquire for anyone not on good terms with the Institute, and expensive even then.</p>\n<p>Each piece of Synth armor other than helmets can accept two mods, one of which is a Material, the other of which is an Upgrade. Synth helmets may only accept a Material mod. For mods applied to Torso armor, double the weight and cost (this has already been done for Torso Only mods). All Synth Armor Material mods are&nbsp;<span class=\"fontstyle2\">installed with the Repair skill.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Synth Amor:</strong> Laminated, Resin, Microcarbon, Nanofilament</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
